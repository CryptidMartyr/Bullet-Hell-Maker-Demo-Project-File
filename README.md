# Bullet-Hell-Maker-Demo-Project-File
A demo for a bullet hell maker I've scrapped for now. might come back to the concept later.

-main scene is tutorial, fullscreen it
-click new spawner
-add a bullet to put a bullet in the "bullet queue" of the spawner. if youve ever played noita, its like that
-add a mod to either the spawner or bullet to make it move, it can only do some preset equations cuz i was planning to make this into a game as i said
-click and drag spawners to move their position
-ignore all the numbers in the center and the right, those are all just game idea stuff
